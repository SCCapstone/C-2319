# C-2319

>Our team has decided to develop an online platform where students, faculty, and staff can freely buy and sell items from each other. This website will be exclusive to University of South Carolina students, faculty, and staff. A university email address will be required when signing up for an account. Our goal for this website is that it will provide a safe environment for students (both undergraduate and graduate), faculty, and staff to buy and sell their goods. The Idea is similar to Craigslist, but without the risk of not knowing who you are meeting in person. This website should ideally be usable on laptop and desktop computers.

# Technologies
